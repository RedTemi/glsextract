I want to extract the following data from the pdf I just sent, there are many pages like this, on each page the tables start in the same ways, the charges can be in any combination of the charges I outlined below and the amoubnts corresponding to those charges are beside them to the right in the "amount" column. write a script in nodejs or python that extracts the data and puts it into a json file, if you do not understand anything ask questions, if you understand everrything, output the script.



the base data from the table includes

    waybill_id,	date,	weight,	unit,description,	pickup,	pieces,	total,	destination

 

charges include
